# DataFest2024 Transformer Classification Project

## Purpose
The **DataFest2024 Transformer Classification** project aims to utilize Transformer models for the classification of educational data. The primary objective is to showcase how Transformer architectures can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of classification tasks compared to traditional models.

## Important Features
This project incorporates several key components:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Extensive cleaning and preparation of the dataset are undertaken to ensure optimal conditions for model training and evaluation. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
- **Model Architecture**: The core of the project is the implementation of a Transformer model tailored for classification tasks. This includes configuring the model's layers, attention mechanisms, and embedding layers to handle sequential data effectively.
- **Training and Evaluation**: Scripts are provided to train the model on the preprocessed dataset and to evaluate its performance using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Hyperparameter tuning is also performed to optimize the model's performance.
- **Visualization**: Tools are included to visualize the training process, including plots of loss and accuracy over epochs, confusion matrices, and other relevant performance metrics to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the model's behavior.

## Results
The implementation of the Transformer model resulted in a substantial improvement in classification accuracy, achieving an accuracy rate of approximately 95%. The model's performance metrics and visualizations are detailed in the `results` section, highlighting its superiority over baseline models. These results underscore the model's effectiveness in handling complex classification tasks within the educational data context.
